# Rhog
Just me trying to figure out how basic haskell and gloss work by trying to make a simple tiled roguelike.
What works :  - Building the map picture from an int list and separate tiled images 
              - Moving the player around on floor and open door tiles
              - That is all
              
What I'm working on : - Level generator
                      - Reducing RAM usage
                      - Monsters
                      - Centering the window on the player character
                      - Sound
                      - Figuring out what the fuck I am doing
